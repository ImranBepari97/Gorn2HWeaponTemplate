# Gorn Two Handed Weapon Template

A Weapon Template for making Two Handed weapon mods in Gorn.

Gorn is a Virtual Reality game, made by Freelives. It's a game featuring gladiator combat in an arena, and is best described as a power trip.
With modding becoming a thing for the game, people were very excited to add their own weapons into the game, but so far none have been able to add two handed weapons.

Until now!

This template allows one to add your own two handed weapons into the game.

# Requirements

- Unity 2017
- Visual Studio
- A legal copy of Gorn
